## FireBase Setup 

* Create project in firebase
* Click on Authentication tab and get started
* Under sign-in method, enable Google sign
* You can get your Firebase configuration object containing keys and identifiers for your app under Project settings in Firebase
* Navigate to /src in client and create firebaseCredentials.js file
* Replace with your own credentials
* Navigate to /config in server and create serviceAccountKey.json

firebaseCredentials.js
```javascript 
  const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  authDomain: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  projectId: "XXXXXXXX",
  storageBucket: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  messagingSenderId: "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
  appId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  measurementId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  BASE_URL: "http://localhost:3000"
};

export default firebaseConfig;
```


serviceAccountKey.json
```json
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "private_key_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "private_key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "client_email": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "client_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "auth_uri": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "token_uri": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```
